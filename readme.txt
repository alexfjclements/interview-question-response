## This is a small script created in response to an interview question I
## recieved. It is designed to print a pattern of asterisks to the terminal,
## after prompting the user to input the desired number of asterisks in the
## pattern. If the number is unsiutable, the program returns an error
## stating that the chosen number must have an integer root.
